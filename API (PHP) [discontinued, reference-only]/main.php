# Caching rhizome nodes & subscriptions schema
  Because some clients already hold knowledge of this database.
  ... might want to skip this comment if reading for the first time


  Schematics of this functionality (which was in development):
  -> ./cache-subscriptions.txt

  Architecture without an external caching database & subscription message queue
 (eg. Redis & RabbitMQ):
    $GLOBALS['nodes-sent'] array for subscriptions (data residing on connected devices)
    $GLOBALS['nodes-memory'] array for in-memory cache
    $GLOBALS['nodes-cache'] array for database cache

  With blockchain, any changes to data states are stored in the distributed database
  This API aims to emulate some core features a decentralized network of nodes running blockchain 

    * creating a data pool accessible accross many services the user chooses to share it with (this database isn't distributed, though)
    * maintaining proof for validity of data

  Doing so we keep in mind necessities of the blockchain paradigm shift, enabling a smoother passage onwards (trust in central authority's proper management is needed until processed data is signed by users as well as functions/objects dealing with it - without the possibility of tampering with internal states)

  Networks of brain and computer nodes are more aware when interacting to collaboratively shape a more complete, data driven picture
  A majority consensus on validity of data is needed for this to kick in, enabled by...

    * a process of collecting, storing and processing data that enjoys trust at both both ends, social and technological
    * trust in validity of data is based on a mathematical proof that is socially accepted (merkletree)
    * on the social end trust is enabled by a critical mass of ethical peers, beholding personal traits such as { "values": ["honesty", "integrity", "responsibility", ...] }
    * based on a need from which changes sprout, adoption of a process is social proof of it's validity

  As such, this API (a milestone in research for a project) aims to serve as a spark imagination, supporting transition of collective memories from conscious experiences into data blocks (by criteria of simultaneous occurence, as with core blockchain protocol; by additional relational criteria, as will be seen with sharding on blockchain and data distribution on Peer2P networks)
