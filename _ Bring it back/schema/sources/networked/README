Remote online sources, with their distinct protocols:
- Websites (HTTP/S) - 'permalink URLs' and distinct 'HTML DOM containing elements'
- APIs (HTTP/S - RESTful, GraphQL, ...): 'URL' routes, arbitrary 'query' names and identifying 'parameters'
- Sources with own proprietary protocols

As 'routes' to data and its 'schema' are not static in longterm and 
changes to their routing/naming conventions are usually not communicated in a structured way, 
there should be a map of current state (consider NPM packages with a generic naming convention)
